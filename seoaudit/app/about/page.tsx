Our Philosophy
SEO doesn't need to be difficult. While there are more than 200 Google ranking factors that determine a website's ranking in the search engine listings, the overall purpose of SEO is straightforward:

To help search engines better understand a website's intended topic or niche.
Improve a website's user experience and credibility (through relevant backlinks) to validate the site's value to search engines. 
SEO Site Checkup offers an easy-to-understand and comprehensive set of SEO tools to help you understand your website from a search engine's perspective. In just a matter of few seconds and a couple of clicks, you can see how a search engine may interpret your site. Our SEO reports also let you know of any problems or technical shortcomings in your website that may be hurting your search engine rankings.

We are proud that our SEO reports focus on the latest SEO trends and factors. For example, a website's loading speed is a relatively newer search engine ranking factor. Our SEO toolbox covers all such analysis to help you compete and succeed in the modern digital marketing world.
